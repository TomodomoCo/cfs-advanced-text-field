# CFS Advanced Text Field

This plugin adds a new field type to Matt Gibbs' [Custom Field Suite](https://github.com/mgibbs189/custom-field-suite) that enables support for additional text input options and attributes, many of which were introduced with HTML5.

## Options

The following options are supported:

| Option             | HTML Attribute | Description                                                                   |
|--------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Input Type         | type           | HTML5 field type: text, email, number, tel, or url                            |
| Cast Return Value  | n/a            | Cast the returned value as a string, int, float, or bool (defaults to string) |
| Default Value      | value          | Value for the field upon creation                                             |
| Placeholder        | placeholder    | Text to display as the input placeholder                                      |
| Required           | required       | Mark the field as required (also adds "required" attribute, unlike CFS core)  |
| Validation Pattern | pattern        | HTML5 validation pattern regexp, for client-side validation                   |
| Max Length         | maxlength      | Maximum number of characters                                                  |
| Number: Min        | min            | Minimum value for a number field                                              |
| Number: Max        | max            | Maximum value for a number field                                              |
| Number: Step       | step           | The amount to increment or decrement the number field when stepper is clicked |

Note that these options (with the exception of "Required" and "Cast Return Value") are client-side validators, and shouldn't be trusted to completely prevent bad input.

The number-specific options are only visible once you've saved an Advanced Text field with the "number" type (similar to saving after adding a loop field).

Casting the return should be used with caution. You will probably want to enable a validation pattern to be extra certain the data is input properly. Note that by default, "no" and "false" strings will be cast to `false` when you select the `bool` cast option. To disable this, add a filter to your functions.php or elsewhere: `add_filter('cfs_advanced_text_allow_bool_cheats', '__return_true');`

## Browser compatibility

While most major/recent browsers support the HTML5 input attributes and field types, some don't. Notably, Safari (for the Mac or iOS) and certain older Android versions won't actually notify the user if their input is invalid before submitting a form (although it won't POST the invalid input).

Additionally, Internet Explorer only started supporting client side form validation in version 10.
